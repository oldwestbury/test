See http://www.ehow.com/how_5805520_use-freeze-damage-fruit-trees.html for example which recommends a sprinkler. The \"releases heat\" thing is kind of an oversimplification, but basically as long as you have any liquid water around, it will keep things at zero. The sap of your tree is not pure water, and therefore freezes somewhat below zero. By having the water freeze instead you stay away from the temps that would damage your plants. That said, http://www.ehow.com/how-does_5245655_spraying-frost-protect-fruit-freezing_.html is total gibberish since evaporation doesn't generate heat, quite the opposite.

I know one who was the runt of her litter and has been extremely thin all her life, to the point where you can easily count every bone. She is now 17 years old, having outlived two other cats in that household, so it certainly doesn't seem to have held her back.\n",
            "\t [2] \t\t 24.0 \t\t Yes. Just like us, cats vary in size and shape and weight. And like us, some of that is diet, some is health, some is genetics, some is age. One of my lady's cats was the runt of the litter; it wasn't certain she would survive, and she has always been both small and skinny. It hasn't seemed to limit her climbing/jumping much, if at all; I think she benefits from square/cube law to be stronger relative to her weight than you would expect. Another cat in the family was not only longer/taller/broader but also more solidly muscled. I think he may have weighed twice what the small one did, without being overweight. (The simplest rule-of-thumb test for whether a cat is overweight: if you can count every vertibra as you run your hand down their back, they're fine. If some or all of them are hard to feel through the skin, there's probably more fat there than there should be. The runt really is below ideal weight; not only can you feel every bone in her back, it's somewhat hard to believe there are muscles and tendons there. Especially true now that she's a senior catizen.)\n",
            "\t [3] \t\t 22.1 \t\t Thank you for your question. You have a few different issues within your one question, but let's start with your main question regarding cats eating each other's food. I have the same problem with my cats. I have one cat who gorges herself, and I have one skinny cat who likes to graze all day long. What do you do with this situation? It is not easy. You have to get a little creative. And unfortunately you will likely never get to the point where they will only eat their own food. However, you can get to a point where they mostly eat their own food. One thing to note is that cats tend to be dominant over certain things. Cats are not usually dominant over everything, like dogs tend to be. Some cats are dominant over food, which it sounds like your cat is. My thin cat will not eat unless my overweight cat is eating. You can see the obvious dominance there. Here are some ideas for you... KEEPING CATS FROM EATING EACH OTHER'S FOOD I feed my cats wet food at night. I feed the slightly overweight cat in one place and my thin cat on a high shelf where she can see the other cat eating. During the day, I feed my overweight cat using an interactive feeder, so she has to use her natural instincts to work for her food. I give my skinny cat a small bowl of dry food on another shelf, so she can graze. It's not that my overweight cat can't get to the other food, but she is content to eat her easier-to-get food. Each morning, I also feed my skinny cat dry food in our closet, which is at the end of our walk-in bathroom. So there is quite a buffer from the bathroom door. I turn on the fan, so the other cat (who is closed out) cannot hear my skinny cat crunching. The things we do for our cats! I also sneak my skinny cat treats now and then. CATS EATING DOG FOOD This is a real problem for inside cats. You have to stop this. Even though your cats may be healthy now, eating dog food will make any cat overweight and unhealthy. I have volunteered at an animal shelter for many years and have seen this problem over and over again with overweight cats given to the shelter. Feed your dog at times you can supervise and take up the bowl when your dog is finished. If you kennel your dog, feed him in his kennel, so the cats can't get to the food. CAN CATS EAT VEGAN FOOD This is the most difficult part of your question because I can tell you have strong convictions in this area. However, I must tell you that cats should not ever be on a vegan diet. I am very sorry. I know this is difficult to hear. Cats were built to be obligate carnivores. They must have the taurine from the meat because they cannot produce it on their own, like dogs can. I know some vegan pet foods have synthetic taurine, but I wouldn't chance this. It is just not the same. Cats on a vegan diet will likely have severe medical conditions. See the quote below from Pet WebMD If allowed to continue long enough, these dietary problems can lead to serious and sometimes irreversible medical conditions. The one veterinarians mention most often is taurine-related dilated cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart with weak contractions and poor pumping ability). Low taurine can also lead to reproductive failures, growth failures, and eye problems. I hope this helps and at least gives you some ideas. I wish you and your animal family the best!\n"
